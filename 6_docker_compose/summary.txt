WHY DOCKER COMPOSE?
1 - Configure relationships between containers
2 - Save our docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
3 - Create one-liner developer environment startups
4 - YAML-formatted file and CLI tool docker-compose
====================
- YAML file can be used with docker-compose command for local docker automation
====================
-- docker-compose CLI --
   - not a production-grade tool but ideal for local development and test
   - docker-compose up & docker-compose down ~ 2 most common apps
    > cd compose-sample-2
    > docker-compose up
    > docker-compose ps
    > docker-compose top
    > docker-compose down
======================
-- Using Compose to Build Images --
+ we can also build custom images
+ docker-compose up OR docker-compose build (for rebuild)
+ great for complex builds that have lots of vars or build args

  > cd compose-sample-3
  > docker-compose up
  > docker-compose down
  > docker image rm nginx-custom
  (delete 'image: nginx-custom in the yaml file)
  > docker-compose up -d
  > docker images ls
  > docker-compose down --rmi local
=====================
